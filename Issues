1. Pre-populate the password_confirmation field with the value of the password field in the app/views/users/new.html.erb file.
2. In the app/models/user.rb file, the password attribute is not marked as protected. This means that anyone who has access to the database can view the user's passwords.
3. In the app/controllers/users_controller.rb file, the create action does not validate the user's input. This means that a user could create an account with an invalid email address or password.
