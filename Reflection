REFLECTION:What I Experianced

Working on issues for other projects in open source has been a rewarding experience. At first, it was a bit frustrating. I had to learn a new way of working and I wasn't sure what to expect. But as I got more involved, I started to see the benefits of working in an open source community.
One of the best things about open source is that there is a huge community of people who are willing to help each other. When I ran into a problem, I could always find someone who was willing to help me out. This was a huge relief, especially when I was feeling stuck.
Beyond technical skills, working on open-source projects also nurtured my communication and collaboration abilities. Engaging in discussions, providing feedback, and addressing concerns within the community required effective communication and interpersonal skills. I learned to express my ideas clearly, listen attentively to others, and navigate conflicts constructively. These soft skills are invaluable not only in open-source development but also in various other professional contexts.
Overall, my experience in contributing to open-source projects was a transformative one. What initially seemed like a daunting challenge gradually evolved into a stimulating journey of personal and professional growth. The constant pursuit of solutions, the diverse interactions, and the continuous learning opportunities shaped me into a more resilient, adaptable, and skilled developer.
Overall, though, I've had a great experience working on issues for other projects in open source. It's been a rewarding experience that has helped me to learn new skills and to meet new people. If you're thinking about getting involved in open source, I highly recommend it.
Here are some of the specific things I learned along the way:
●	How to work effectively in a team environment
●	How to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds
●	How to troubleshoot and debug complex problems
●	How to use a variety of different programming languages and tools
●	How to contribute to a large and complex codebase
●	How to work under pressure and meet deadlines
I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on these projects and I am excited to continue contributing to open source in the future.

1. Pre-populate the password_confirmation field with the value of the password field in the app/views/users/new.html.erb file.
2. In the app/models/user.rb file, the password attribute is not marked as protected. This means that anyone who has access to the database can view the user's passwords.
3. In the app/controllers/users_controller.rb file, the create action does not validate the user's input. This means that a user could create an account with an invalid email address or password.
